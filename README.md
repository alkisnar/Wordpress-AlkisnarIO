# Wordpress-AlkisnarIO
Main Website

This was a site I created to mark my completion of the Cloud Resume Challange!
I was able to use Cloudfront, Lambda, CodeCommit and an EC2 instance to build this landing page and the wordpress blog behind it.

I utilized Python, CSS, Javascript, HTML to get it working, and also needed to configure JSON policy statements to get the proper permissions.
